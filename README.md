# Fate-GO-Character-Guesser
A small web application to guess characters from the mobile game Fate/Grand Order

I have been extremely into the Fate video game franchise for many years since I first watched the anime many years ago. It's basic premise is that 7 magicians fight in a battle royale by summoning heroes and legends from throughout history and mythologies. So you might have a battle where King Arthur is fighting Heracles, or Robin Hood fighting the Emperor Nero Claudias. It was dope.

In 2015, the franchise saw a new mobile game called Fate/Grand Order, which had a cast of all the different heroes from past games, and well as hundreds of new ones created specifically for the game. With such a wide cast of characters, there became a YouTube trend where fans would show off characters to their non-fan friends and have them try to guess their name. I made a web app to simulate that, because I too thought it would be fun to torture my friends.

As a side note, this was originaly made as a Python project beforee I scrapped the idea. However, the code for that project still lives in the python-version branch.
